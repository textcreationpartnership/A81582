            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Am not ignorant (Chriſtian Reader) that many <hi>Catechiſmes</hi> more pithy and profound then this, yea far tranſcending it both for <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> have already been publiſhed, and this needs no more then to help the great ſun with a little light; or to put a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous patch upon a compleat Suit. Yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the books which have been or ſhall be edited in this kind, I may thus much ſay, none of them that ever I ſee, but in ſome particular have what another wanted, and ſome one abridged, when ſome other dilated: all of them being chriſtian competitors, ſtriving who ſhould conduce moſt to ſhew the readieſt way to the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>So then, if this poor peece may be any thing, but even Gotes haire towards the ſanctuary of the Lord, nay may it but add one little grain to Gods great granarie, I ſhall be glad and give God the glory of it. Beſeeching our Lord Jeſus Chriſt that great Shepheard of his ſheep to make this and all the labors of his beloved ſervants fruitfull Paſtours for the comfort of his little flock. And the perpetuall praiſe of his Holy Name, Amen.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label> No, for the Heavens hold his body until the day of the reſurrection of all things, but the bread repreſents his body, as the wine doth his blood, ſeeing that by one oblation he hath conſecrated for ever thoſe that are ſanctified.</p>

               <label>A.</label> Yes, but not the works of our will, but ſuch as God hath commanded; and then to have no truſt in them, for when we have done all that we can we are unprofitable ſervants.</p>

               <label>A.</label> In examination of our ſelves, whether we have a godly ſorrow for our ſins paſt, and purpoſe of a new life. Secondly, Whether we have faith to take hold of Chriſt and his righteouſneſs. Thirdly, Whether we have love, declaring us one Body. Fourthly, Whether we be thankful to God for his benefits.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Q.</label>

               <label>Q.</label> 
               <hi>How is that obtained?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label> By prayer made in Chriſt his name, that we eat not, nor drink not unworthily, 'tis good that we come together in prayer, joyning together with the Miniſter in the Congregation, that we may worthily take it. God grant us ſo to do.</p>
